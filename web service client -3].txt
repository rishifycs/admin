Aim: Develop client which consumes web services developed in different platform.
Requirement: Visual Studio Community 2017 (Version : 15.8 or latest)

In this practical we are creating Web Service in Visual Studio ant then we willconsume it in NetBeans.

1. Open Visual Studio IDE and click on File.
File -> New -> Project
2. Click on Web.
 Select ASP.NET Web Application and give Name as Service. After that clickon OK button.

8. After click on Add button, Operaion.asmx.cs file will be automatically openotherwise open it from 
Solution Explorer and Add the following code intoClass Operation.
[WebMethod]
public double Add(double a, double b)
{
double sum = a + b;return sum;
}
[WebMethod]
public double Multi(double a, double b)
{
double Multi = a*b;
return Multi
}
After that press Ctrl+S to save the methods. Actually we are creating twomethods for Web Service. One
is for addition of two numbers and secondone is for multiplication of two numbers.
9. Now run the project by click on Green arrow button below the Windowmenu.
10. A window will open in browser and that is our web service.
11. You can check services by click on Add or Multi option. But we don’t need this.
12. Now a new window will open. Select the link and copy it. We will use thislink in NetBeans to
consume these services.
13. Don’t close Visual Studio and browser, just minimize it otherwise serverwill stop. But save the link
anywhere, so that we can use it later.
14. Now open NetBeans.
15. Create a Web Application with name ServiceClient. Next -> Finish.

double num2 = Double.parseDouble(request.getParameter("txt2"));
28. Now pass num1 & num2 to a & b variable respectively. After that pressCtrl+S to save this code.
